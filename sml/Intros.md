#SML Introduction

##Basic
SML is a functional programming language. It uses two environment to store the running status of a program, the **static environment** and the **dynamic environment**.

The **static environment** stores the type for each expression.
The **dynamic environment** stores the value of each expression.

There is **no** variables in SML which means there is no mutation.

SML uses REPL as its programming environment. It's quite different from the well known edit-compile-run environment.

To learn more about REPL, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop>

##Loops
There are no loops in SML. Use recursion instead.
